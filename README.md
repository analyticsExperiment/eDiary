# eDiary

This project contains a minimal example of an electronic diary application with a Node.js backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.

## Features
- Create daily entries with mood and short questionnaires (energy, stress, sleep quality, anxiety) plus optional notes.
- View entries for the current month.
- Simple mood analytics chart over time.
- Sleek interface with subtle animations.

## Running
Start the server and open the app in your browser:
```bash
node backend/server.js
```
Then visit `http://localhost:3000/`. The same server now provides both the API and the frontend.
